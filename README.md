# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
###The purpose of this project is to prepare tidy data from Raw Data set
###Also need to submit code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up ###the data called CodeBook.md and a README.md in the repo which will explains how all of the scripts work and how they are ###connected.

##Created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
###1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
###2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
###3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
###4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
###5)From the data set in step 4, created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each ###activity and each subject.
